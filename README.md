Hello, I am *Khaki* (or Khaki-git) and I use GitHub to open source my projects for anyone to use. ðŸ« 
All of my work is under the [***GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE***](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)

I primarily make Python programs and occasionally make websites using the Flask framework.
I've been interested in Machine Learning but don't know where to start, I mean I know how it works (I don't) and have made AI "software" but all of it was done following tutorials.

Thanks for reading.
